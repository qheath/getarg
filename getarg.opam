synopsis: "Command-line option parser"
description: """
This library offers an alternative to the standard OCaml Arg module
with a support for short and long options (Ã  la getopt).
It is similar to Getopt and Getopts, with a few key differences:
  - long options (with an expanded form that can take a mandatory
    argument)
  - no expanded form for short options with optional arguments
  - clusters of short options (mixing with and without arguments)"""
